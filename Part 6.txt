Part 6:
Some of the issues that someone might obtain during development of this program is not accounting for 
the threads to be occuring at the exact same time, and not taking measures as in synchronization,
conditional variables, lock mechanisms, semaphores, etc to allow for a smooth execution of the 
simulation. Time dependency depending on the strength and speed of the running program will be 
a cause for inconsistent results depending on who is running the program. When these actions take time 
to finish, it could cause multiple aircraft to be run into the same program location at the same
time causing incorect results and even a permenant lock. A potential solution to this issue could
be to us conditional varibales to assign wait-times before and after actions which would allow the
program to properly run through the simulation. The conditional varibale allows for notifying the 
wait varible for when it has properly run which will fix the problem states above potentially.
