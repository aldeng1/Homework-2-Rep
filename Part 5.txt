Question 5:
Multiple issuses could be causes if a robot is assigned a new task immediately. First, the robot 
will essentially be working non-stop with no breaks and no other robot will be able to operate 
next to each becuase the tools will never be available. Another issue would be that depending
on the programming, the robots could collide when reaching for the tools if there is no seperation
in task assignance. A potential solution to this task would be to add a buffer time or deley before 
the robot who just finished his task can attempt to grab the tools again.
